The Bees were making coffee with emacs.
They had become my first real enemies,
when I started trying to question their every word.
The first thing I asked was how it worked.
How did it make the coffee?
Did they make it fresh or did they store it in mugs?
The answer was that it didn't make coffee, the first two words were dead on.
